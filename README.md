**Kit 1 - Windows Migration Starter Kit**
This Starter Kit deploys everything you need to migrate an on-prem Windows Domain and File Server to AWS. Out of the box, the intances are sized for domains that are 50 users or less. Included in the setup is the VPC networking, Network ACLs, Virtual Machines, Security Groups, a Site to Site VPN Tunnel, Dashboard, Alarms, and Backups. All of this is deployed automatically for you. In addition, each EC2 instance contains automation scripts that automate the migration of Active Directory and the file server at the click of a button. No advanced cloud knowledge is necessary!
